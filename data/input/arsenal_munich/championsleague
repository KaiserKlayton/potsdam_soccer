    69

    Start Time
    The second half begins.
    The visitors kick-off for the second half and they will be hoping for more of the same, although they will hope Alexis Sánchez and Theo Walcott threaten a little bit less than they did in the first half. Arsenal will be desperate to score as they aim to enhance their Group F hopes.
    End Time
    The referee blows for half-time.
    Bayern may have dominated possession (70%), but will Arsenal live to rue missing those first-half chances. The best of the bunch fell to Theo Walcott from five metres out as Manuel Neuer produced a stunning save to deny the forward.
