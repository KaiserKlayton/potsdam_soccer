End Time
The final whistle is blown.
And it is all over, and that might ring true for Arsenal's UEFA Champions League hopes this season too. Top seeds Bayern München await for the Gunners, who need nothing but six points from the German champions. A historic victory for the Greeks, their first in England, and a deserved one played with quick, direct football.
