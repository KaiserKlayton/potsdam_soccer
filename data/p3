<<<<<<< HEAD
My name is Ben Cullimore and it's been an absolute pleasure describing all of the action to you this evening. Until next time, goodbye!
The victory moves Arsenal equal on points with second-place Manchester City, over whom they have a game in hand, and five points clear of Manchester United, whilst Hull remain one point outside of the relegation zone but now sit in 17th place after dropping behind Leicester City on goal difference.
Despite coming away with nothing, Hull can take plenty of positives from their second half performance, as they looked bright on several occasions when they pushed forward in numbers to put the Arsenal defence under pressure. However, in the end, their poor display in the opening 45 minutes meant that it was a relatively easy evening for the Gunners, who were able to hold on to pick up three well-deserved points.
FULL-TIME: HULL CITY 1-3 ARSENAL
90' + 4'
A Hull attack breaks down midway inside the Arsenal half of the pitch, allowing the visitors to push forward on a quick counter attack. Sanchez darts towards the hosts' penalty area before firing a low shot towards the bottom left-hand corner of the net, but it's slightly mishit and ends up trickling just wide of its intended target.
90' + 2'
Excellent opportunity for Walcott! Bellerin picks up the ball on the right-hand side of the Hull penalty area before cutting a great pass back to the substitute, who then ends up sending his first-time curling shot just wide of the far post.
90' + 1'
Chester sends a lovely lofted pass forward that flies over the top of the Arsenal defence and into the path of Brady, but the Irishman is just slightly offside and the linesman's flag is immediately raised.
90'
The fourth official has indicated that there will be four minutes of added time.
89'
It's all Arsenal at the moment as they continue to put the Hull defence under plenty of pressure, and, despite being two goals behind and in desperate need of a late push, the hosts have almost every available body camped behind the ball.
87'
Wilshere embarks on a great run down the right flank, beating Meyler with ease before being nudged over from behind by the Irishman just inside the Hull penalty area. The Arsenal players and fans half-heartedly appeal for a penalty but the referee shakes his head and waves play on.
86'
Substitution Olivier Giroud Theo Walcott
Arsenal have decided to make their final change of the evening, with Walcott coming on to take the place of Giroud.
85'
Great chance for Arsenal! Bellerin fires in an excellent shot from the right-hand side of the penalty area that is parried into the path of Wilshere, but he sees his close-range shot blocked on the line by Chester. The ball then bounces to Sanchez, but Harper rushes out to force the Chilean into sending his effort on goal into the side-netting.
84'
Arsenal patiently pass the ball around on the edge of the Hull penalty area, with Sanchez and Cazorla both eyeing up potential shots. The Spaniard does eventually fire a strike towards goal that Harper is just about able to parry away with an outstretched foot.
82'
Cazorla finds Ozil in plenty of space on the left wing, and the German then sends in a low cross towards that near post that is deflected out of play for a corner. The resulting set-piece is well struck but is comfortably dealt with by Huddlestone, who heads the ball away from danger.
81'
Substitution Stephen Quinn Nikica Jelavic
Hull have made their final substitution of the game, with Quinn making way for Jelavic, who comes on to make his first appearance for almost two months.
80'
Hull put the Arsenal defence under plenty of pressure, with Brady being presented with three opportunities to fire a cross into the visitors' penalty area, but each one is dealt with extremely well by the Gunners, who hold firm against the hosts' onslaught.
78'
El Mohamady chips a wonderful pass into the path of Meyler, who is completely unmarked on the right-hand side of the Arsenal penalty area, but the Irishman's cut-back towards N'Doye is poorly hit and can only find Mertesacker near the penalty spot.
76'
Lovely play by Arsenal! The visitors exchange a series of intricate passes inside the Hull penalty area before Ozil cuts the ball back to Cazorla, but the Spaniard's first-time low volleyed shot from close range is stopped well by Harper.
75'
Ospina unleashes a huge kick that flies over the top of the Hull defence and into the path of Sanchez, but Harper does extremely well to dart out and collect the ball before thumping it away from danger.
73'
The corner is flung towards the near post where it almost finds Mertesacker, but it's comfortably cleared away by a strong header from Robertson.
72'
Sanchez steps up and fires a curling shot from the resulting set-piece, but this time it takes a deflection that sends it safely away from goal and out for a corner.
71'
The game is briefly stopped as Meyler receives medical attention at the other end of the pitch. The Irishman received an accidental boot to the face after clashing with Koscielny just outside of the Arsenal box.
70'
Great play by Wilshere! The substitute immediately charges forward on an excellent run, twisting and turning through a sea of Hull players before being brought down on the edge of the penalty area, resulting in a free kick for the visitors in a very dangerous position.
68'
Substitution Aaron Ramsey Jack Wilshere
And now Arsenal have made a substitution, with Ramsey making way for Wilshere, who comes on to make his first appearance since November.
66'
Robertson is immediately involved in the action as he tries to find Brady, who has moved into a more advanced position, but the substitutes' pass is poor and rolls harmlessly out of play a throw-in near the halfway line.
65'
Substitution Sone Aluko Andrew Robertson
And now Ramsey goes close! Giroud and the Welshman play a series of quick passes between one another 25 yards out before the latter eventually tries to curl a strike into the top right-hand corner of the goal, but it's not hit as well as he would have liked and ends up flying wide of its intended target.
65'
Hull have decided to make their second change of the evening, with Robertson coming on to take the place of Aluko as the hosts switch to a more attack-minded back four.
64'
Excellent play by Arsenal! Ozil breaks forward before teeing up Sanchez, who darts down the left flank before unleashing a cross-cum-shot that Harper punches away from danger with a strong fist.
63'
The resulting set-piece is flung into the heart of the penalty area, where it finds Mertesacker. He nods the ball down onto the head of Giroud, but the Frenchman tries to tee up Koscielny instead of going for goal himself and his selfless pass is cut out comfortably on the edge of the six-yard box.
62'
Arsenal are finally able to bring a period of Hull dominance to an end, with Giroud and Cazorla linking up wonderfully well on the edge of the hosts' penalty area before McShane is just about able to poke the ball out of play for a corner.
60'
McShane goes close! Again, El Mohamady fires a brilliant curling cross into the middle of the Arsenal penalty area, where it finds the head of the aforementioned defender, but his effort ends up flying just a few yards over the top of the crossbar.
59'
Coquelin flies into the back of Quinn and ends up accidentally standing on the Irishman's ankle, leaving the Hull midfielder in serious discomfort and the hosts not best pleased with the Frenchman.
58'
The Hull fans are in fine voice as the hosts push forward once again, and there seems to be a feeling of belief around the KC Stadium thanks to that wonderfully-worked goal.
56'
Assist Ahmed El Mohamady
56'
Goal Stephen Quinn
Goal! Hull have pulled one back! El Mohamady picks up the ball in acres of space 30 yards away from goal and sends a briliant curling cross into the heart of the Arsenal penalty area, where Quinn fires an excellent header past the outstretched hands of Ospina and into the top right-hand corner of the net. Game on!
55'
Great chance for Ramsey! The Welshman pushes forward before playing a quick one-two with Sanchez on the edge of the Hull penalty area, but he ends up sending his toe-poked strike just wide of the near post.
54'
Sanchez spins on the halfway line before sending an absolutely excellent lofted pass through the middle of the Hull defence and into the path of Giroud, but Harper does well to read the flight of the ball and quickly sprints out to cut out the danger.
53'
Bellerin skips past Brady on the right flank before cutting into the penalty area, but Quinn does well to dart across the box and dispossess the Spaniard before he can get a cross away.
51'
Arsenal patiently pass the ball around in the middle of the pitch, and they don't seem to be in any particular hurry to push forward as they look to keep hold of their three-goal lead.
49'
It's been a rather scrappy start to the second half, with both sides committing several poor challenges in the middle of the pitch as the two teams battle for possession.
47'
Hull immediately push forward, with Meyler getting involved in the action straight away before teeing up Aluko, but the Nigerian striker ends up firing his 25-yard strike comfortably over the top of the crossbar.
46'
Substitution Jake Livermore David Meyler
Hull have decided to make one substitution during the half-time break, with Meyler coming on to take the place of Livermore, who was booked during the first period.
46'
And we're underway once again!
The two teams are making their way back out onto the pitch ahead of the start of the second half.
It's been a truly dreadful first half for Hull, who head into the break three goals down and with little chance of coming away with any points. Arsenal have been brilliant, with some of their passing in the hosts' half of the pitch being truly out of this world. Sanchez, Ramsey and Ozil have run the show in the final third, and the Tigers' back three have looked extremely lacklustre as a result.
HALF-TIME: HULL CITY 0-3 ARSENAL
45' + 1'
Assist Aaron Ramsey
45' + 1'
Goal Alexis Sánchez
Huddlestone is caught in possession near the halfway line, allowing Arsenal to break away extremely quickly. Ramsey then unleashes a brilliant through-ball that finds Sanchez, who skips past Harper before easily slotting the ball into the back of the net. It's not even half-time yet and the visitors have all but wrapped up the victory.
45'
The fourth official has indicated that there will be two minutes of added time.
45'
Cazorla sends yet another excellent pass through the middle of the Hull defence and into the path of Sanchez, but Harper does extremely well to rush out and save the Chilean's toe-poked shot with a one-handed save.
44'
A lovely series of passes from Arsenal ends with Ozil on the edge of the penalty area after playing a wonderful one-two with Sanchez, and the German then unleashes a great low shot that Harper does well to stop with a strong diving save at the near post.
42'
El Mohamady sprints down the right wing before sending yet another dangerous low cross into the heart of the Arsenal penalty area, but it's just about dealt with by the Gunners' defence, who have been put under an incredible amount of pressure over the last few minutes.
40'
Aluko is brought down by Koscielny, resulting in a free kick for Hull just inside the Arsenal half of the pitch. It's sent quickly to N'Doye, who breaks through the visitors' defensive line before firing a low shot that ends up flying just wide of the far post. The linesman's flag is quickly raised, however, and Arsenal are awarded a chance to breathe.
38'
Hull immediately break away on a quick counter attack, with N'Doye skipping past Bellerin with ease before darting down the left flank. He then tries to curl a low cross into the path of Aluko, but he completely miskicks his attempted pass and it's sent trickling into the hands of Ospina.
37'
Cazorla breaks through the middle of two Hull defenders before firing a great low shot that Harper is forced to tip round the near post. The resulting set-piece is then sent in low by the Spaniard but is easily dealt with by the hosts' defence.
35'
Once again, El Mohamady does well to dart down the right wing before sending in a low cross that finds its way to Livermore on the edge of the penalty area, but the former Tottenham midfielder spends far too long on the ball and is dispossessed comfortably, allowing Arsenal to break away quickly.
33'
Assist Santi Cazorla
33'
Goal Aaron Ramsey
Goal! It's 2-0! Cazorla receives the ball on the halfway line and sends an absolutely wonderful lofted pass right into the feet of Ramsey, who spins round Brady on the edge of the Hull penalty area before sending a deflected shot off the foot of the defender and into the top left-hand corner of the net.
32'
Hull look far more determined since going behind, but they're finding it incredibly difficult to break down Arsenal's resolute defence, despite their best efforts.
30'
Yellow CardDame Ndoye
N'Doye cynically trips Monreal over from behind as the left-back tries to break away on a quick counter attack, and as a result the Senegalese striker becomes the second Hull player to enter the referee's book.
28'
Goal Alexis Sánchez
Goal! What a strike by Sanchez! The Chilean steps up and fires a curling shot that deflects off Dawson before flying into the roof of the net. Harper looked to be going the right way but was put off by the deflection, which sent it away from his outstretched arms.
27'
Huddlestone is caught napping in a dangerous position inside the Hull half of the pitch, allowing Sanchez to dart forward before being tripped over by Livermore just a few yards outside of the penalty area.
26'
Ramsey hobbles off the pitch to receive further medical treatment, but it looks as if he's going to be able to continue after a few moments on the sideline.
25'
Ramsey and Huddlestone clash after a poor first-touch from the Hull midfielder sees him lunge into the Welshman, leaving the latter on the floor in serious pain.
23'
Yellow CardJake Livermore
Livermore clumsily fouls Sanchez and picks up the first booking of the game as a result.
23'
What a chance for Aluko! Brady picks up the ball on the left flank and whips an excellent cross towards the back post, but the Nigerian striker, who is in a wonderful position on the edge of the six-yard box, ends up sending his header down into the ground and away from goal.
21'
Audacious effort from N'Doye! The Senegalese striker spots Ospina off his line and decides to try and beat him from 40 yards out, but his strike is poorly hit and ends up flying comfortably wide of its intended target.
20'
El Mohamady does well to push down the right wing before sending a deep cross towards Quinn, who gets up high but can only send his headed effort looping several yards wide of the far post.
19'
The resulting set-piece is swung into the heart of the penalty area, where it can only find the head of Coquelin, who then quickly tees up Ozil. The German immediately embarks on a blisteringly quick counter attack before sending the ball back to the aforementioned Frenchman, but he raises his boot too high whilst battling with El Mohamady and Hull are awarded a free kick inside their box as a result.
18'
Mertesacker charges into Quinn and brings the midfielder crashing to the ground with a hefty shoulder barge, resulting in a free kick for Hull in a very dangerous position on the left flank.
16'
Ozil makes a good run behind the Hull defensive line to reach a lofted forward pass, but he's unable to find a red and white shirt with his attempted back-heel, which is cut out comfortably by Dawson.
14'
Great strike by Sanchez! The Chilean sprints through a sea of Hull players before firing a wonderful low shot from just outside of the penalty area that Harper does well to parry away with a strong diving save. It's almost pushed into the path of Giroud but Dawson does well to cut out the danger before the Frenchman can unleash a follow-up effort from close range.
13'
El Mohamady uses his pace well to beat Monreal near the corner flag on the right wing before curling a looping cross towards the edge of the six-yard box, but it's sent slightly too near to Ospina, who comfortably collects the ball.
12'
Bellerin and Cazorla link up well just outside of the Hull penalty area before the latter sends the ball into the feet of Giroud, who is camped deep inside to box. The Frenchman tries to twist quickly to get a shot away but is dispossessed at the vital moment by Dawson, who then clears the danger.
10'
Almost a terrible mistake by Huddlestone! Bellerin twists and turns on the right flank before beating Brady and firing a cross into the heart of the Hull penalty area, where it deflects off the aforementioned midfielder before flying into the hands of Harper.
8'
After a few moments receiving medical attention on the sideline, Coquelin jogs back onto the pitch and is able to rejoin the action.
7'
Hull are awarded a free kick just inside the Arsenal half of the pitch after a poor challenge from Giroud, and it's thumped towards the edge of the penalty area. Ospina rushes out and punches the ball away from danger but also catches Coquelin, who receives a fist in the face that leaves him in a heap on the ground.
6'
Hull are finally able to string a few passes together before Harper tries to find El Mohamady with a long kick forward, but it ends up bouncing over the head of the Egyptian before going out for a throw-in midway inside the Arsenal half of the pitch.
4'
Arsenal patiently pass the ball around midway inside their own half of the pitch before Coquelin tries to send a long pass into the feet of Giroud, but it's poorly hit and flies past the striker before bouncing out of play for a goal kick.
2'
Monreal breaks down the left flank before curling a very dangerous low cross towards the near post, where it meets the outstretched foot of Ramsey. The midfielder is just about able to make contact with the ball but ends up sending his toe-poked effort a few yards wide of the Hull goal.
1'
And we're off! Arsenal get us underway, attacking from left to right.
