# potsdam_soccer

The goal of potsdam_soccer is to represent text from online soccer tickers in Answer Set Programming (ASP) via the controlled language of Kicktionary, a dictionary of soccer terms that defines lexical units, frames, and hierarchies involved.

Sub-goals:

- merge information from multiple tickers into a single representation.

- provide query functionality. For example:

- how many passes were there during the game?
- who won?
- how many red cards were there?
